This is a 24 hour Arduino Clock.

Turn potentiometer connected A1 all the way to the right to enter setup mode.
In setup mode, turn the other potentiometer connected to A0 to change the value of the clock. Turn the A1 potentiometer in the other direction to set the time.

Once the time is set, it cannot be changed until reboot.
